# Fake News Detection  

This is a basic NLP project that classifies news articles as **real** or **fake**. The project leverages a pre-labeled dataset and implements Logistic Regression for binary classification. It also includes a deployed web app built using Streamlit for interactive usage.  

## 🔍 Overview  
Fake news detection is increasingly important in today's digital age, where misinformation spreads rapidly. This project explores a simple approach to identify fake news using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.  

## 🚀 Features  
- Pre-processed Kaggle dataset labeled as `0` (fake) and `1` (real).  
- Logistic Regression model for text classification.  
- Deployment of the model via Streamlit for easy interaction.
